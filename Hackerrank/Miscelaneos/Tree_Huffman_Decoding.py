# Huffman coding assigns variable length codewords to fixed length input characters based on their frequencies. 
# More frequent characters are assigned shorter codewords and less frequent characters are assigned longer codewords. 
# All edges along the path to a character contain a code digit. If they are on the left side of the tree, they will be a 0 (zero). 
# If on the right, they'll be a 1 (one). Only the leaves will contain a letter and its frequency count. All other nodes will contain a null instead of a character, and the count of the frequency of all of it and its descendant characters.

# For instance, consider the string ABRACADABRA. 
# There are a total of  characters in the string. This number should match the count in the ultimately determined root of the tree. 
# Our frequencies are  and . The two smallest frequencies are for  and , both equal to , so well create a tree with them. 
# The root node will contain the sum of the counts of its descendants, in this case . 
# The left node will be the first character encountered, , and the right will contain . 
# Next we have  items with a character count of : the tree we just created, the character  and the character . 
# The tree came first, so it will go on the left of our new root node.  will go on the right. 
# Repeat until the tree is complete, then fill in the 's and 's for the edges. The finished graph looks like:
